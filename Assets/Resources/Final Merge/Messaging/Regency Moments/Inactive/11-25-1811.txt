11-25-1811$NONE$ $To every pint of port wine allow 1 quart of boiling water, 1 quarter pound of sugar, 1 lemon, grated nutmeg to taste.
The wine need not be very old or expensive for the purpose, a new fruity wine answering very well for it. Put the wine into a jug, rub some lumps of sugar (equal to 1/4 pound) on the lemon-rind until all the yellow part of the skin is absorbed, then squeeze the juice, and strain it. Add the sugar and lemon-juice to the port wine, with the grated nutmeg; pour over it the boiling water, cover the jug, and, when the beverage has cooled a little, it will be fit for use. 
Negus may also be made of sherry, or any other sweet white wine, but is more usually made of port than of any other beverage. 
Allow 1 pint of wine, with the other ingredients in proportion, for a party of 9 or 10 children.
