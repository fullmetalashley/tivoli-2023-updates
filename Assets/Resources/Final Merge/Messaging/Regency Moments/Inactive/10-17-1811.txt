10-17-1811$NONE$ $The youngest and most reckless of the Bennet daughters, Lydia Bennet is fifteen years old but goes out and about in society with her older sisters. Lydia is the pretty and vivacious reflection of Mrs. Bennet. Although her fun-loving, laughing style is attractive to some, she is generally inconsiderate and her outrageous behavior causes trouble for her family. 
"She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officersâ€¦ had increased into assurance." -- Chapter 9 
Lydia is joined at the hip by her next older sister, Catherine. Known as Kitty in the family, the fourth Bennet sister is the least defined. She's sort of an amalgam of Mary and Lydia. And because Lydia can do no wrong in Mrs. Bennet's view, Kitty bears the brunt of her mother's frets and scolds.
