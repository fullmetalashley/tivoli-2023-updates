10-8-1811$NONE$ $While Mr Bennet likes and appreciates his two oldest daughters for their wit, he is at best an indifferent father. He is an intelligent man with a wry sense of humor, and Elizabeth is clearly fond of him. Mr. Bennet's main flaw is indolence; he habitually avoids accountability for his daughters' future and leaves his family to fend for itself. 
"Mr Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humor, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character."
