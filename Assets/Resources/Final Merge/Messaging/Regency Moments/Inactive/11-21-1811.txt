11-21-1811$Longbourn House $November 21st$Dear Charlotte,
Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to Longbourn today and have just left. They've given us their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield--it has been fixed for Tuesday next! 
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend Jane again, calling it "an age" since they last met. They repeatedly asked what she has been doing with herself since their separation. 
To the rest of us they paid little attention. Miss Bingley and Mrs Hurst avoided my mother as much as possible, and said not much to me. They were soon off, and rose from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, I daresay! 
I trust that Lucas Lodge will soon receive a similar visitation, if you all have not already.
Yours,
Lizzy$INSERT HEADER HERE$CHAR
