10-29-1811$NONE$ $Ah, Mr. Darcy. He is <i>the</i> paragon of late 18th century masculine virtues, and arguably the most romantic hero in English literature. (Little 'r' romantic; don't @us, BrontÃ« fans.) 
Darcy is also the wealthiest person, by far, in Austen's works. He is reserved but charming, proud but vulnerable, rational but with deep emotions. He's misunderstood by nearly everyone, including Elizabeth at first. His pride sets up her prejudice in Volume 1; later on, his integrity encourages her to examine her own assumptions. 
"Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year." -- Chapter 3
"I could easily forgive <i>his</i> pride, if he had not mortified <i>mine</i>." -- Elizabeth Bennet
"I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do." -- Charles Bingley
"Pride has often been his best friend. It has conencted him nearer with virtue than any other feeling." -- George Wickham
