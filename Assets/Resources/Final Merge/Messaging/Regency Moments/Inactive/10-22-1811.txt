I find myself in agreement with your observation that Jane is yielding to the preference which she has entertained for Mr. Bingley from the first. She may indeed be in a way to be very much in love.
Because Jane unites a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner with her with great strength of feeling, you mentioned your pleasure that Jane's preference is not likely to be discovered by the world in general.

However, I think it may become her disadvantage. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. 

There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all <i>begin</i> freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. 

Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly! But he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.

Yours,
Charlotte$INSERT HEADER HERE$CHAR
