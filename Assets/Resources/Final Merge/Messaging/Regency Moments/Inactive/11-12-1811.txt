11-12-1811$Netherfield Park, Hertfordshire$November 12th$My dear Friend,

If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
Yours ever,

CAROLINE BINGLEY$INSERT HEADER HERE$CHAR
