12-1-1811$NONE$ $The tradition of marking the days of Advent with a special calendar of treats and surprises developed after the English Regency period. Such calendars became popular in England during the Victorian era, as so many German Christmas traditions did.
Jane Austen was an enthusiastic sister, aunt, and friend who enjoyed games and holidays with her family. We believe she would have liked Advent calendars, and we at Minerva Interactive hope you'll enjoy this one inspired by her life and times. 
(Besides, Lizzy and Jane could probably use a distraction after Mr. Bingley's departure and Charlotte's engagement to Mr. Collins.)
