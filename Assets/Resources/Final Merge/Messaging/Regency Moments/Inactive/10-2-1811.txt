10-2-1811$NONE$ $Called "Lizzy" by her family and close friends, Elizabeth is the second eldest of the five Bennet daughters whose marriage prospects so concern their mother, if not their father. She has a " lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous."
"Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia." -- Mrs. Bennet
"Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters." -- Mr. Bennet
Elizabeth is not a conventional beauty by the standards of the day. Mr. Darcy considers her only "tolerable" at their first meeting, though he soon comes to value her "fine eyes" and intelligent character.
