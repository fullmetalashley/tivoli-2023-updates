The Longbourn Entail,  a private monograph  by Miss Mary Bennet

My father's property consists almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, is entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation named William Collins. 
My mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life (her father was an attorney and left her four thousand pounds), can but ill-supply the deficiency in my and my sisters' prospects. 
The entail is a subject on which my mother is beyond the reach of reasonable discourse. She continues to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cares anything about. 
She is in favor of him paying his addresses to one of us. Jane has hopes of securing Mr. Bingley, and Elizabeth will likely refuse anyone suitably moral. I believe I might be prevailed on to accept him. From what I know of him, there appears to be a solidity in his reflections which strikes me as amiable. Though he is by no means so clever as myself, I think that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as mine, he might become a very agreeable companion.
I, Mary Bennet, could be the daughter who saves Longbourn!
