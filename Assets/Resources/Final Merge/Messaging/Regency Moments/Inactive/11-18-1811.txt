11-18-1811$NONE$ $Mr. Collins is the cousin and male heir of Mr. Bennet. He is a clergyman with a parish and income that are part of the Kent estate of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who is herself the aunt of Mr. Darcy. 
Mr. Collins is an obsequious, dull but well-meaning young man who feels his obligation to Lady Catherine and other persons of rank very deeply. He equally feels the weight of his own consequence at all times, and his manner of courting "eligible females" is the stuff of legend.
"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society." -- Chapter 15
"It is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of prevous study?" -- Mr. Bennet
