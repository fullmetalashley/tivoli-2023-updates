11-29-1811$Netherfield Park, Hertfordshire$November 29th$My dear Jane,
My brother imagined that the business which took him to London yesterday might be concluded in three or four days. We are certain it cannot be so, and have determined on following him thither. That Charles may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel, we will all dine at Mr. Hurst's house in Grosvenor Street.
Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, the affection that Georgiana Darcy inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. 
My brother admires her greatly already, and now he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing. Charles is most capable of engaging any woman's heart, and with nothing to prevent an attachment, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings. In the meanwhile, we will hope to lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.
Yours ever,
Caroline Bingley$INSERT HEADER HERE$CHAR
