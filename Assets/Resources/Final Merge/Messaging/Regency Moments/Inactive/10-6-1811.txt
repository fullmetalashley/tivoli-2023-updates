10-6-1811$NONE$ $Jane is the eldest Bennet sister and the closest emotionally to Elizabeth. Jane is even-tempered, kind, and generally assumes the best about those around her. She is the most reserved of the Bennets, which makes some people believe that she is indifferent or unaware, but she is neither.
"To be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone." -- Elizabeth Bennet 
Because she is the eldest, Jane is introduced and referred to in Regency society as "Miss Bennet." Her younger sisters are differentiated by their first names (e.g., "Miss Mary Bennet"). 
Jane is considered beautiful by her friends and family and certainly by Mr. Bingley. However, Austen does not describe her physical looks, and portrayals of Jane as blonde and blue-eyed are simply a convention.
