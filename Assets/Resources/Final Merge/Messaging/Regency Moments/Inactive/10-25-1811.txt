10-25-1811$NONE$ $Charles Bingley is the "single man in possession of a good fortune" whose arrival in Hertfordshire begins Pride and Prejudice. He is kind, open-hearted, and good looking. He's also a bit feckless and easily swayed by stronger personalities. 
His family's fortune was acquired through trade. Although Bingley himself never says this is a concern, he is diffident about his status and regularly defers to his socially superior friend, Mr. Darcy. 
"Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on." -- Charlotte Lucas
"He is just what a young man ought to beâ€¦ sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" -- Jane Bennet
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents." -- Mr. Bingley
