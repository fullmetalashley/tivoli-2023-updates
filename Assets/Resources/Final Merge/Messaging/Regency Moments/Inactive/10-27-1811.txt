10-27-1811$Meryton, Hertfordshire$A Sunday Note from Mrs. Phillips$Dearest Sister,
When Kitty and Lydia joined us for tea yesterday with Mr. Denny and some other of the officers, your girls exclaimed especially about the apple puffs which our cook recently introduced. They insisted we share the recipe with Hill. Do let me know how you are getting on with the folk at Netherfield. Yours, etc.

APPLE PUFFS
Pare the fruit, and either stew them in a stone jar on a hot hearth, or bake them. When cold, mix the pulp of the apple with sugar and lemon-peel shred fine, taking as little of the apple-juice as you can. Bake them in thin paste in a quick oven; a quarter of an hour will do them if small. Orange or quince marmalade is a great improvement. Cinnamon pounded, or orange-flower water to change. $INSERT HEADER HERE$CHAR
