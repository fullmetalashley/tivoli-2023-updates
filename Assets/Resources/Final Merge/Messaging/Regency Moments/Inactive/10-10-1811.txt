10-10-1811$NONE$ $It's interesting to note that the words and actions of Jane and Elizabeth's mother, Mrs. Bennet, both open the novel and close out Volume 1. 
Mrs. Bennet is a profoundly silly woman, and in today's terms might be seen as neurotic, but she's arguably the more engaged parent who worries deeply for her daughters' (and her own) future. What little inheritance or dowry the Bennet girls may receive comes from the money that Mrs. Bennet brought to her marriage, because Mr. Bennet's estate of Longbourn is entirely entailed. 
Austen succinctly describes Mrs. Bennet in the novel's first chapter:
"<i>Her</i> mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news."
Mrs. Bennet has a sister, Mrs. Phillips, who lives in the nearby town of Meryton. Their brother, Mr. Gardiner, lives in London. The Bennets socialize and correspond frequently with the Phillipses and the Gardiners. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, especially, are close to their nieces Jane and Elizabeth.
