10-21-1811$NONE$ $Sir William Lucas and his family are the Bennets' closest friends in the neighborhood, and Charlotte is their eldest. She is Elizabeth Bennet's best friend. 
At twenty-seven, Charlotte is several years older than Jane and Elizabeth. Although she's not yet an old maid, Charlotte's prospects for marriage and her own household are seen as limited and diminishing every year. 
Charlotte Lucas is very aware of her situation and her family's expectations and concerns. She's more pragmatic than any of the Bennet women, and she acts strategically when the opportunity presents.
"Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want." -- Chapter 22
