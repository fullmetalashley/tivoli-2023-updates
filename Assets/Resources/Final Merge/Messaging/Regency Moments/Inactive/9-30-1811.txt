During the 18th and early 19th centuries, people who wanted to travel long distances at speed hired a <i>post chaise</i>, a relatively light style of carriage with a closed body and four wheels that could be harnessed to two or four horses. 
Such transportation was generally private and more comfortable than traveling on a mail or stage coach. A postilion rode one of the horses harnessed to the chaise on the left, road-edge side, and passengers could view the road ahead through windows. (Some chaises were open; there were many styles over time.) Fresh horses, and sometimes fresh postilions, were kept for fast changes at coaching inns along regular routes. 
"And four" refers to the number of horses Mr. Bingley hired. More horsepower meant a faster but more expensive journey, and Bingley's ability to travel both privately and at speed indicates his wealth. A very rich person like Mr. Darcy might own a chaise and keep his own horses along routes that he commonly travelled.  
A post chaise cost more than a public stage coach, but multiple parties could split the cost of a chaise journey, rather like a rideshare.
