11-7-1811$NONE$ $Writing letters was the primary means of communication between neighbors and friends. Short notes and invitations were delivered between households multiple times a day. Mail carriers delivered regularly around neighborhoods, and wealthy people employed footmen to dispatch messages privately.
Postage was determined by the distance a letter had to travel and by the number of sheets used. Because paper was expensive, so people often wrote long letters in very tight lines all the way to the margins on both sides of a sheet of paper. The practice of cross-writing was popular, in which one would turn a filled sheet sideways and overwrite the earlier lines. (Pity the person who received such a letter!)
Postage was usually charged to the recipient. Members of both houses of Parliament had "franking" privileges, enabling them to post letters and packages free of charge. Envelopes were not widely used. Instead, letters were folded, sealed with wax, and addressed on the outside. 
The ability to compose thoughtful insights or entertain with wordplay was a highly regarded skill. Letter writing was considered a sign of wealth and respectability.
