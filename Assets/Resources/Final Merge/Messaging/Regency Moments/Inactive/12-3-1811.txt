12-3-1811$Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent$Monday, 2nd December$My dear Sir,
Allow me to express, with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in your family might prompt, my deepest thanks for your hospitality during my recent sojourn in Hertfordshire. 
It is my earnest hope that all your family are persuaded of my deepest happiness in having obtained the affection of your amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas. My patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, so heartily approves of my intent to marry Miss Lucas that she wishes the event to take place as soon as possible. I trust this will be an unanswerable argument with my amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making me the happiest of men. 
It is merely with the view of enjoying her society that I find myself so ready to close with your kind wish of seeing me again at Longbourn. I hope to be able to return on Monday fortnight. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,
William Collins$INSERT HEADER HERE$CHAR
