12-24-1811$Longbourn, Hertfordshire$Christmas Eve 1811$My dearest Daughters,
<i>England was merry England, when 
Old Christmas brought his sports again.
'Twas Christmas broach'd the mightiest ale; 
'Twas Christmas told the merriest tale;
A Christmas gambol oft could cheer 
The poor man's heart through half the year.</i>
-- Sir Walter Scott, "Marmion," 1808
Yours ever,
Father Christmas$INSERT HEADER HERE$CHAR
