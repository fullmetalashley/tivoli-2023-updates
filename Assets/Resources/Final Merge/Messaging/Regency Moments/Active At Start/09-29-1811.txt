Have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last? Mr. Morris told me that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England! He came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place... Can you imagine it?
I heard that he was so much delighted with Netherfield, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately. He took possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are in the house this week!
I need not remind you, my dear friend, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. You may be sure I intend to introduce him to my dear nieces as soon as may be! And of course, I will be happy to make him known to your girls should the occasion arise. You know you may always count on me.
Wishing you a happy quarter day,
Mrs. Long
P.S. His name is Bingley.$INSERT HEADER HERE$CHAR
